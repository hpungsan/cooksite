# Garnish - ANTH 220 Final Design Project Demo Site

Welcome to the demo site for **Garnish**—an innovative app designed to inspire people to cook, share recipes, and connect with a vibrant community. Garnish combines gamification, social features, and rewards to make cooking an engaging, fun, and social experience. This repository hosts the Next.js demo site for showcasing the final design concepts of the Garnish app as part of the ANTH 220 Final Design Project.

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and was initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) to facilitate a smooth development workflow.

## Project Overview

The **Garnish** app is designed to bring people together through cooking. By blending gamification, social interactions, and a rewards system, Garnish encourages users to try new recipes, share their own, and participate in a community of food enthusiasts. This demo site highlights our final design prototype, which is the outcome of the ANTH 220 Final Design Project.

## Getting Started

To set up Garnish locally, clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/garnish-demo
cd garnish-demo
npm install
```

### Development Commands

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the demo site.

## Editing and Customization

You can begin customizing the demo by editing the main page, located in `app/page.tsx`. Thanks to Next.js’s hot reloading, any changes you make will automatically update in the browser.

## Fonts and Styling

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for font optimization, incorporating the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family provided by Vercel. Styling can be easily adjusted within the CSS files in the `styles` directory.
